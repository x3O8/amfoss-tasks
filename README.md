# amfoss-tasks
Hello! I'm Abhijith, a fresher from the AI and DS branch. I come from Calicut and my interests lie in robotics and programming. I used to go for robotics competitions and stuff until 11th grade. Most of the robots ive built are focused towards a particular competition like the racing robot, the accelerometer controlled robot or the autonomous firefighting robot but other than that ive also made things like automatic lighting system for houses and an aquarium monitoring system that can keep track of the pH levels, temperatures and lighting requirements of the system. 

Why should you choose me?
I'm fairly experienced in programming and hardware. The languages im familiar with would include python, c++, arduino, etc.
Im a competitive person, which makes me want to be the best. Im also a fast learner, especially when it comes to something im actually interested about, so I can start making some actual progress quicker. I'm also very persistent or someone who doesnt stop trying to figure out why something doesnt work and eventually fix it (definitely not healthy but one worth mentioning nonetheless :) )

What are my goals for the next six months? How will I accomplish them?
Thenext six months for me seem very foggy, as i am still very new into an environment like this. But I hope to join amFOSS, hone my skills and maybe even learn something new all while also giving much importance to my college curriculum as I am yet to learn how to balance both. They way I can accomplish this is by trying my best to complete the tasks and by asking for advice from others as to how they managed to get their college and club activities in sync.

How will you contribute back to the club?
As ive mentioned before, Im fairly experienced in programming and hardware so I can start being productive earlier than my peers who are from the biomath background.
